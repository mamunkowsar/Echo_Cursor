# Simplified Chevelle Landing Page (Structure-First)

This workspace contains a simplified, **structure-focused** HTML recreation of the landing page at [`https://chevelle.com/`](https://chevelle.com/).

## What&#39;s included

- `index.html`: A single, self-contained page using semantic HTML (header/nav/main/footer), accessible labels, and minimal CSS for readability.

## How to view

Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click it or drag it into a browser window).
